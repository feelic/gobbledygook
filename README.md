# gobbledygook

This package aims at randomly generating human languages.

## Language generation

The language is generated in layers:

### Phonemes

Each language will get a random set of vowels and consonants.

- 4 to 20 vowels
- 5 to 30 consonants

### Morphemes

Morphemes will be made using a series of phonemes.

### Morphology

The language will be either isolating, fusional or agglutinative

### Grammatical features
